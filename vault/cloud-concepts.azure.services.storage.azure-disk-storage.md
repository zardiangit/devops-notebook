* Disk storage is specially used in Azure [[VMs|cloud-concepts.azure.services.compute.azure-virtual-machines]].

* It is a disk emulation service in the cloud allowing customers to attach *persistent storage* to their VMs, both for operating systems and their application data.

* Customizable for
  * sizes,
  * types (SSD, HDD),
  * performance tiers


* Disk can be `Managed` or `Unmanaged`  
    i.e each disk is stored as a file on a blob storage.
