* Application gateway is also a [[load balancer|cloud-concepts.azure.services.networking.azure-load-balancer]], but it is specially designed to support web traffic (http/https).

* Some key features are
  * web application firewall
  * redirection capabilities
  * session affinity (redirecting same users to the same servers)
  * url routing
  * ssl termination (decrypting the https requests before sending it to the VMs)
