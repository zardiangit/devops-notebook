There are two types of package managers working in a linux system.

**low-level** :  
These tools take care of unpacking the package, running scripts and installing the said package correctly.  
`dpkg` and `rpm` are the most popular low-level tools for package management.


**high-level** :  
These tools are tasked with shorting out package dependencies and downloading the base package from the vendor.  
`apt`, `dnf`, `zypper` and `yum` are the most popular high-level tools for package management.
