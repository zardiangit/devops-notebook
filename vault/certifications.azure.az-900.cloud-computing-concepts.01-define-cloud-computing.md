Cloud is essentially a scaled up PC with access to lots of resources, that is stored in a cloud provider's data center, instead of physically being with you. This lets you customize and only pay for the amount of power and features that you need to run your softwares.

Each cloud provider may have different selection of services to choose from, but the basic services provided by all cloud providers are Compute Power, Storage and Networking.

Cloud providers may also manage the upkeep of the computer, so you don't have to. They will make sure that there are backups, the OS is up to date, as well as making sure that everything is up and running 24-hours a day.

So as your needs grows and your requirements change, you can quickly bring on new computing resources in a cost effective way.
