> Initiating the #90DaysofDevOps this week with a review of all the concepts I have already studied thus far.  
> Will be following the roadmap from @SaiyamPathak, journal of @MichaelCade1 and documenting the process with @dendronhq (VSCode based PKM).  

02
>Come with me on the journey of DevOps to see, can I beat this timeframe and learn to write better technical blogs and documentation?  

03
>I will be putting all the daily summaries on my github and will drop a hashnode blog on some topic if I believe I am qualified to write.

04
>Continuing with python practice, started solving some problems on @exercism.
>Coding has never been my stronger suit but as it's said, "practice will take you there".
>So, from now on my time will be split between >#python and #devops.
>#Coding #CodeNewbies
